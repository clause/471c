L1 provides a language that executed each sentence in the order given by `then` statement. It has the following statements:
- Immediate: to assign a constant to a variable
- Primitive: to compute `left` `op` `right`
- Branch: to jump between statements
- Halt: to end the execution of the whole program

Comparing to L2, L1 is at the lower level, replacing nested expressions with explicit sequences.
