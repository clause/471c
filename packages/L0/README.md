L0 provides a basic assembly language. A program in L0 language contains procedures, which are made up with multiple statemsents. Each statement can perform operations in memory or between two variables.

Comparing to L1, L0 doesn't have `Abstract`/`Apply`, losing the ability to define runtime functions and tail calls. Instead, all code should be executed in the pre-defined order.
