# made for later use in L3 to convert into L2
# from L2 import syntax as L2
# from . import syntax as L3
# based on how it looks from him is its like the check.py but with l3.the case name
# and then some basic conversion stuff of l2. instead of a check for duplicates and stuff like that
# returns on things like branch is return L2.Branch (all the thing in branch = recur(thing in branch))
# L3.Reference(name = name) becomes
# if name is a recursive variable -> Load(reference name)))
# else return Reference(name = name)
