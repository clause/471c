Within syntax.py l2

Once again the program code as a whole is made in Program this time being labelled/named "l2"

Term shares all the aforementioned terms of l3 except for letrec

All the still existing classes look to be the same as in l3

Due to this I'm able to conclude that the only visible difference is a lack of recursion, at least in a direct fashion.
