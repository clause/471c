L2 provides a basic frame of multi-function program. Users are able to define variables, functions, and manipulate the memory with array-like data structures.

Comparing to L3, L2 doesn't have `LetRec`, which indicates that the user need to define a recursion manually, that is, to store the recursive function in an array and then invoke it.
