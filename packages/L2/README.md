L2 is the next step in the process, becoming somewhat more stripped down in comparison to L3 before it.

For starters, syntax supports one less operation, having removed LetRec from the list of possible functions. What this means for function is that there is no longer a Let function equvalent that performs the action in a way that would work well with a recursive function, therefore simplifying, or limiting, the available options.

Besides this, little else is different between this language and L3, with both being structured almost identically were it not for the removal of LetRec.
